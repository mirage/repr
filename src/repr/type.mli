(** Yet-another type combinator library

    [Repr] provides type combinators to define runtime representation for OCaml
    types and {{!generics} generic operations} to manipulate values with a
    runtime type representation.

    The type combinators supports all the usual {{!primitives} type primitives}
    but also compact definitions of {{!records} records} and {{!variants}
    variants}. It also allows the definition of run-time representations of
    {{!recursive} recursive types}. *)
