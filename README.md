`Repr` is a library of type combinators for defining runtime representations of
OCaml types and operations that are generic over those representations (`pp`,
`to_string`, `compare` etc.)

This library is currently experimental and provides no stability guarantee. The
API is available [online][api]. A detailed documentation can be found [here][docs].
